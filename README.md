ParticleFlow

We were asked to get a basic GLuT/ opengl project from github and explain it to the lab instructor. For my lab, I chose this one , originally from

* https://github.com/sotoea/2D-Particle-System 

I made some partial tweaks. Although my target was make the code as readable as possible. 
The code was initially very well written too. 
I have added as much as documentation in the code as possible. 

Have fun!
